This project aims to develop a comprehensive mobile web-based monitoring and management information system for a residential subdivision. By leveraging RFID technology, the system will enable real-time tracking and monitoring of various assets and resources within the subdivision, such as security access, vehicle movement, and maintenance equipment. This system will provide subdivision administrators with a centralized platform to efficiently manage operations, optimize resource allocation, and enhance overall security and safety for the residents. The integration of mobile accessibility and web-based architecture will ensure seamless accessibility and user-friendly experience for both administrators and residents, ultimately improving the quality of life and community management within the subdivision.
